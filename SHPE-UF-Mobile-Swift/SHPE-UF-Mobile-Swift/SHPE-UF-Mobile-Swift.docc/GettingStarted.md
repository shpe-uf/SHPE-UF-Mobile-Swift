Prior to working on the SHPE UF Mobile App, it is essential that you first learn the basics of **Swift**. Swift is a beginner-friendly programming language designed to make app development intuitive and efficient.  

### Key Features of Swift  
- **Live device simulator**: Simulate an Apple device of your choosing to test the format of your application. Very useful for debugging and design testing.  
- **Straightforward syntax**: Swift is relatively easy to learn, featuring simple commands that permit readable code. Itâ€™s simple to structure code neatly while still being clear in purpose.

## Xcode  
Swift can be run on a Mac using **Xcode**, Appleâ€™s integrated development environment (IDE). Xcode is a great platform for building apps, testing code, and managing projects.  

With Xcode you can:  
- Build full apps or experiment with Swift using *Playgrounds*.  
- Utilize templates for different application types.  
- Customize your development environment with tools and settings.

## Next Steps  
1. Install Xcode from the Mac App Store (itâ€™s free!).  
2. Start a new SwiftUI project in Xcode.  
3. Replace the default `ContentView` with your own code.  
4. Use the canvas on the right side of Xcode to preview your changes live.
