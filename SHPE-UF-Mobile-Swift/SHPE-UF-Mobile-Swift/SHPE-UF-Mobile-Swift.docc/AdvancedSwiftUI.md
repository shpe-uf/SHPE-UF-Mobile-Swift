## Advanced UI, State, Project Architecture, & Testing  

Use the MVVM Model to separate the GUI from the business logic and back-end logic.

## Overview  
As your program develops in complexity, it is essential that the code remains clean and readable. Advanced SwiftUI development focuses on managing complex state. A common design pattern UI developers use is the **MVVM Model (Model-View-ViewModel)**.

## What is MVVM?  
The MVVM model helps organize code by separating three aspects:  

- **Model**:  
  The data layer of your application. It includes the data structures, business logic, and networking code. Models typically donâ€™t contain any UI logic and can be reused in different parts of your app.  

- **View**:  
  What the user interacts with. This contains your View structs. Views should be simple, displaying only what the ViewModel tells them to. They should not handle any business logic.  

- **ViewModel**:  
  The logic that connects the data to the UI. It processes data from the Model into a form the View can use. It also features logic for handling user interactions, state management, and other behaviors.  

### Benefits of MVVM
By using the MVVM model, it becomes easier to:  
- **Maintain and Scale**: Each component has a clearly defined role, decreasing the likelihood of tangled code.  
- **Test Logic Independently**: The ViewModel can be tested without relying on the View or needing a UI.  
- **Promote Reusability**: The Model and ViewModel can be reused in different parts of the app.

## Example Use Case: Weather App  
- **Model**: A struct `WeatherData`  
- **ViewModel**: A `WeatherViewModel` that gets the weather and displays it through `@Published var temperature: String`  
- **View**: A view that binds to `temperature` and displays it on screen.

## Important Terminology  

- **@State**: A property wrapper type that can read and write a value managed by SwiftUI.  
- **@Binding**: Creates a two-way connection between a property that stores data, and a view that displays and changes the data (e.g., slider, text field).  
- **ObservableObject**: A protocol that allows reporting changes back to any SwiftUI view thatâ€™s watching.  
- **@Published**: A property wrapper used in `ObservableObject` to notify views of changes.  
- **@StateObject private var viewModel = ViewModel()**: Creates a `viewModel` object and includes all the `@Published` variables.  
- **@EnvironmentObject**: Shared data made available to all views through the application (similar to `ObservableObject`).
